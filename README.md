DataCamp course -  Writing Functions in R

### Course Description  
Functions are a fundamental building block of the R language. You've probably used dozens (or even hundreds) of functions written by others, but in order to take your R game to the next level, you'll need to learn to write your own functions. This course will teach you the fundamentals of writing functions in R so that, among other things, you can make your code more readable, avoid coding errors, and automate repetitive tasks
